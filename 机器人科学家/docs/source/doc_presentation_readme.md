## Highlights

$\Phi$-SO's symbolic regression module fully leverages physical units constraints in order to infer analytical physical laws from data points, searching in the space of functional forms. For more details see: [[Tenachi et al 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03192).

Performances on the standard Feynman benchmark from [SRBench](https://github.com/cavalab/srbench/tree/master)) comprising 120 expressions from the Feynman Lectures on Physics against popular SR packages.

$\Phi$-SO achieves state-of-the-art performance in the presence of noise (exceeding 0.1%) and shows robust performances even in the presence of substantial (10%) noise:
